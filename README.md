This implementation of the standard word-search puzzle requires two files:
  --puzzle PuzzleFile
  --words WordList

The puzzle should be a rectangular grid of letters, e.g.

    ATE
    ILL
    LIE

The word list should be one word per line, e.g.

    AT
    ATE
    ILL
    LIE
    AIL
    ALE
    IT

Output lists each word noting success or failure. If found, it also
reports each location and direction for the word. Single letter words
are allowed, and use the non-direction symbol 'X'. All other words use
some combination of U, D, R, L for up, down, right, left.
